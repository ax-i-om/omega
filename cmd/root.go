Tempest is a simple, lightweight, and cross-platform solution 
designed to enable individuals to efficiently discover and 
extract active cloud storage/file sharing links from paste 
platforms such as Rentry.co. It was created to address the 
notable uptick in paste sites being used to distribute content 
that violates copyright and piracy statutes.
